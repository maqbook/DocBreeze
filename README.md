# DocBreeze ðŸ¦™

DocBreeze is a streamlined document analysis application that leverages LLAMA3.2 and advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technologies to provide intelligent document summarization and question-answering capabilities.

## Features

- **PDF Document Processing**: Upload and process PDF documents with high-quality preview functionality
- **Interactive Document Viewer**: Built-in PDF viewer with zoom controls (50% to 200%)
- **Intelligent Question Answering**: Ask questions about your documents and receive contextually relevant answers
- **RAG Implementation**: Utilizes FAISS vector store and LLAMA3.2 for accurate information retrieval
- **History Tracking**: Maintains a session history of all questions and answers
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive interface built with Streamlit

## Technical Architecture

The application is built using the following key technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit
- **Document Processing**: PyMuPDF
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS with Nomic embeddings
- **Language Model**: LLAMA3.2
- **Text Processing**: LangChain

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ollama server running locally
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
